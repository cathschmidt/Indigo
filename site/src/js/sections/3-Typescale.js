          I underwent, during the summer that I became fourteen, a prolonged
          religious crisis. I use “religious” in the common, and arbitrary,
          sense, meaning that I then discovered God, His saints and angels, and
          His blazing Hell. And since I had been born in a Christian nation, I
          accepted this Deity as the only one. I supposed Him to exist only
          within the walls of a church—in fact, of our church—and I also
          supposed that God and safety were synonymous. The word “safety” brings
          us to the real meaning of the word “religious” as we use it.
          Therefore, to state it in another, more accurate way, I became, during
          my fourteenth year, for the first time in my life, afraid—afraid of
          the evil within me and afraid of the evil without. What I saw around
          me that summer in Harlem was what I had always seen; nothing had
          changed.{" "}

          But now, without any warning, the whores and pimps and racketeers on
          the Avenue had become a personal menace. It had not before occurred to
          me that I could become one of them, but now I realized that we had
          been produced by the same circumstances. Many of my comrades were
          clearly headed for the Avenue, and my father said that I was headed
          that way, too. My friends began to drink and smoke, and embarked—at
          first avid, then groaning—on their sexual careers. Girls, only
          slightly older than I was, who sang in the choir or taught Sunday
          school, the children of holy parents, underwent, before my eyes, their
          incredible metamorphosis, of which the most bewildering aspect was not
          their budding breasts or their rounding behinds but something deeper
          and more subtle, in their eyes, their heat, their odor, and the
          inflection of their voices. Like the strangers on the Avenue, they
          became, in the twinkling of an eye, unutterably different and
          fantastically present.
